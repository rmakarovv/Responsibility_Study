What should be done?","Suppose your laptop broke down and you were not able to finish your work on time. Do you think that it is right to penalize you in this case?","Given two tasks, you can't complete both due to a personal fault. The first task is crucial for the client, but you won't suffer much personally if it's delayed. The second task carries a penalty for missing the deadline, though it's less important for the overall project. Which task would you prioritize?","You got a task with an unclear description. Because of your mistake, you noticed it just before the deadline. Would you finish it the way you think is right without asking for help?","You have a project part to complete, but you can only start when your colleague finishes theirs.
